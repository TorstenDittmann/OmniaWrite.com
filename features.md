# No distractions
Being focused on functionality and simplicity, OmniaWrite will not overload users’ attention with decorative elements like shades, colors, details, or animations. In this way, we hope to support a high attention ratio, allowing users to quickly overcome problems as well as easily navigate through our app.

# Minimal
The clean typing interface allows you to focus on writing and shaping your thoughts into text. Dive into your work without distractions and write to your heart’s content.

Many of the world’s best novels were written with the typewriter, so why does it need to be any more complicated than that? Don’t let yourself be distracted by flashy features that can take away from your writing.

Allow your creativity to flow freely without interruption…
