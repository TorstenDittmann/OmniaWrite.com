# ðŸ™‰ No distractions
Being focused on functionality and simplicity, OmniaWrite will not overload usersâ€™ attention with decorative elements like shades, colors, details, or animations. In this way, we hope to support a high attention ratio, allowing users to quickly overcome problems as well as easily navigate through our app.

# ðŸ’­ Minimal
The clean typing interface allows you to focus on writing and shaping your thoughts into text. Dive into your work without distractions and write to your heartâ€™s content.

Many of the worldâ€™s best novels were written with the typewriter, so why does it need to be any more complicated than that? Donâ€™t let yourself be distracted by flashy features that can take away from your writing.

Allow your creativity to flow freely without interruptionâ€¦
