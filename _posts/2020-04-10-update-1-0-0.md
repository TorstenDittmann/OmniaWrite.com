title: Out of beta - Update 1.0.0
---

We are happy to announce that we are now ready to retire our Beta status in exchange for OmniaWrite version 1.0.0!

In addition to fixing and improving on errors, there are also some new features.
Our desktop applications have been completely revised and are now ready to be downloaded.
The background system has also been reworked entirely to provide a better user experience with our cloud features.

Further improvements include:

- Up to 25 back-ups
- Summary of all registered devices
- Secure overview of your account activity like log-ins, etc

In order to facilitate these updates, however, we had to transfer our user database to a new system and, since we have no access to your passwords, we must ask every user to revise their passwords on the new system. This process can be easily completed in OmniaWrite's log-in window and should only take about two minutes.

We hope you enjoy the new and improved OmniaWrite 1.0.0!
